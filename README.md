# Self-Check-Out
The foundational stages of creating a self check-out system fit for a grocery store setting.

This project was the start of creating a look up system for a self check-out. This project contains all methods
					you would need to be the foundation of a UI system. Instead of scanning items, you instead input them by a code as if a computer
					would do after a user scanned an item. Some functionalities include getting and setting codes and prices, adding discounts, and
					comparing products.
